As energy prices continue to rise, vulnerable and low income members of the community are often forced to consider whether they are able to afford the energy costs associated with air conditioning. An increase in heat waves can pose significant health and financial impacts for households that are trying to maintain healthy indoor temperatures. There are several barriers to the installation of solar PV systems for low income and rental households. These include access to upfront capital to purchase and install the solar PV systems; lack of clarity and trust in the solar market; and a split incentive between landlords and tenants, where landlords pay for the solar PV systems, while the tenant benefits from its installation. The Solar Savers Adelaide Program was designed in an attempt to overcome some of these barriers and to encourage the increased uptake of solar PV in residences within the City of Adelaide. Solar Savers Adelaide involves the City of Adelaide providing up front funding for the purchase and installation of solar photovoltaic (PV) energy systems on eligible low-income and rental residential properties. Participating properties will have a ~2kW solar PV energy system installed on their property and Council will recover the costs from participating property owners for facilitating the supply and installation of the solar PV systems through a separate rate charge.","city_location":{"latitude":"-34.928499","longitude":"138.600746"},"country_location":{"latitude":"-25.274398","longitude":"133.775136"}}

It does not currently evaluate any increase or decrease in GHG emissions as a result of stop sign installation or removal.A typical vehicle always burns some amount of fuel when the engine is on, even when the vehicle is not moving (idling), although modern vehicles use much less fuel when idling than in motion. Since burning fuel releases air pollutants and GHGs, cutting down on idling time can help improve air quality and reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Stop signs result in idling, so when examining whether to add or remove a stop sign, it is important to look at the emissions that would result.*reductions that could be avoided if committee voted 'no' to a new stop sign; estimated reductions are per stop sign installed assuming at least 300 vehicles pass through the intersection (minimum required if a new stop sign is installed).","city_location":{"latitude":"38.049365","longitude":"-122.1585777"},"country_location":{"latitude":"37.09024","longitude":"-95.712891"}}

The City has acquired land adjacent to the Bonnybrook Wastewater Treatment Plant former occupied by the Cargill grain elevator. This project will expand the Bonnybrook Wastewater Treatment Plant through the construction of a new dewatering building.  (2) Westbrook Village / LRT Station Redevelopment.

Naturalization Program: Conversion of mowed turf to naturalized grass, shrubs and trees through the naturalization program.  Benefits include carbon sequestration through increased plant material and reduced carbon footprint due to reduced mechanical maintenance. Trees, shrubs and wildflowers are then planted in converted naturalized areas that are suitable for planting.On average in 2014-2015: 35 hectares per year were naturalized (converted from mowed turf to naturalized grass).In 2016 roughly120 hectares were converted saving the City roughlyCDN $200,000 in the turf mowing budget. This savings was realized including costs related to labour, machine/equipment costs, fuel, and supervision.The year-end report for the Root for Trees program  outlines objectives and outcomes of this program, including numbers of trees and shrubs planted.

EnerGuide Assessment and Labelling Program for Residential Buildings: The purpose of this project is to inspire Edmontonians to improve energy efficiency in new and existing homes through the introduction of energy labels that provide information about home energy performance. The desired outcome is to make the EnerGuide label for homes a market norm in Edmonton that attributes value to energy efficiency. This new information is expected to drive energy efficiency improvements in existing homes (through energy efficiency renovations) and in new homes (by increasing consumer demand for energy efficiency). Initially the programs will be voluntary - focused on market champions. This will expand to a City-wide, “opt-in” disclosure program and eventually lead to a City requirement/bylaw. This project aligns with the federal government’s recently released Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate that states: Federal, provincial, and territorial governments will work together with the aim of requiring labelling of building energy use by as early as 2019. Labelling will provide consumers and businesses with transparent information on energy performance. Given the federal government’s signal that regulation are coming, the focus of Edmonton’s program will be to develop a robust voluntary program that supports capacity-building and community participation prior to the regulation coming into effect.  Key efforts to year-end 2016 included: (1) development of a value case for the program, (2)  a contest that awarded EnerGuide audits to 25 Edmonton homeowners in order for the City to learn more about the new EnerGuide rating system and the energy performance of Edmonton’s residential building stock, (3) development of a web-based mapping tool showing the location of contest-winner homes and those of participating builders along with their EnerGuide scores and (4) a video explaining and promoting the EnerGuide program Edmonton’s EnerGuide for Homes: Spot the Difference Next Steps: In Q1, 2017 an approach known as human centered design  will be applied in collaboration with the Government of Alberta and Natural Resources Canada to further understand homeowner behaviour and inform the pilot project design. As well, design workshops will be conducted with stakeholders in Q1, 2017 including the examination of opportunities to align this project with complementary provincial programs.

Large Building Energy Reporting and Disclosure Program: The purpose of this project is to collect accurate, annual information on whole building energy performance across Edmonton’s large building stock, including commercial, light industrial, municipal, institutional, mixed-use, and multi-unit residential buildings (i.e., for the purpose of this project,  large buildings are defined as those greater than 20,000 square feet). The information will be used to benchmark building energy performance across Edmonton’s large buildings and direct energy efficiency improvements in those buildings through the creation of an information-action feedback loop with program participants. The pilot project will be rolled out in stages. In year-one (2017), building owners in Edmonton will be invited to participate in a voluntary pilot where they can choose to report their energy usage for the 2016 calendar year. Many municipally-owned buildings will participate – demonstrating the City’s commitment to lead-by-example. The long-term objective is to increase the number of buildings participating in the program until nearly all large buildings within Edmonton city limits are participating annually.  As with the EnerGuide labelling program for homes (above), this project is influenced by the Federal Government’s recent announcement (in the Pan-Canadian Framework on Clean Growth and Climate Change) – that energy reporting and disclosure for buildings will be regulated nationwide as early as 2019. As a result, this project will focus on preparing Edmonton’s large building sector for the new regulations that are coming and use Edmonton’s experience to influence the national/provincial program that will emerge.Key efforts to year-end 2016 included: (1) significant completion of a value case for the program (compiling theoretical and practical evidence for the program, including an Edmonton building stock analysis and modelling to understand the benefits that can be reasonably expected from the program), (2) building external stakeholder understanding and support for the program (with BOMA Edmonton seen as a key stakeholders) and (3) ensuring strong participation of City-owned buildings/facilities. Next Steps: Design workshops will be conducted with internal and external stakeholders in Q1, 2017 including the examination of opportunities to align this project with complementary provincial programs. It is expected that a well-designed, stakeholder-supported pilot project will be ready for launch in Q2, 2017.","city_location":{"latitude":"53.544389","longitude":"-113.4909267"},"country_location":{"latitude":"56.130366","longitude":"-106.346771"}}

Community Energy Consumption Information Platform: The purpose of this project is to establish an information and analytical tool that will: (a) help citizens understand their personal energy use and actions they can take to conserve and use energy more efficiently, and (b) help City policy makers and program managers understand where and how energy is being used in Edmonton (in order to target energy conservation and efficiency opportunities). The web-based platform that is envisioned will be a place where a large majority of Edmontonians will go to better understand the energy performance of buildings where they work, live and play. This user-friendly environment will allow building owners and occupants to quickly increase their understanding of the electricity, natural gas, water and transportation-related energy consumption by building, street, postal code, neigbourhood and/or city sub-region. Based on building age, size, number of occupants, location and other factors, the system will provide feedback to owners on how the building compares to: (a) buildings of a similar size/age in Edmonton, (b) buildings constructed to the current Model National Energy Code, and (c) other benchmarks that will be helpful to them in understanding building performance. Based on this analysis, the system will be further designed to provide site-specific advice on possible areas of improvement and next steps that building owners can take. The site will be designed to entice regular return visits by providing regular updates of information (at least quarterly), offering incentives and promotions on various devices that improve energy efficiency in buildings, and by providing information and learning opportunities.In 2016, the City of Edmonton hosted a number of stakeholder meetings (involving representatives from EPCOR, ATCO Gas, Enmax, Province of Alberta, Municipal Climate Change Action Centre, City of Calgary and City of Edmonton) to explore the potential for such a platform. Generally, stakeholders expressed strong support for the concept and interest in working together to explore possible solutions. As a first step, the City conducted a request for information (RFI) in April 2016 (followed by a supplemental RFI in August 2016) to obtain advice from proponents on the range of possible solutions and products.  Seven proponents responded, acknowledging the need and value of such a platform and offering a range of advice.  Based on this information, it was concluded that justification existed to proceed with a request for proposals (RFP) for a web-based platform that would be externally owned and operated. However, the RFP did not proceed in 2016 as one of the participating utility companies requested time to evaluate the possibility of it providing the platform.  In the end, they decided the timing was not right to lead such an effort. Next Steps: The City of Edmonton has resumed its leadership role, in close collaboration with the aforementioned stakeholder, to further evaluate options, including the possibility of a RFP or a pilot project in 2017.","city_location":{"latitude":"53.544389","longitude":"-113.4909267"},"country_location":{"latitude":"56.130366","longitude":"-106.346771"}}

Streamlining the Solar PV Permitting Process: The purpose of this project is to establish a permitting process for building-mounted solar PV systems that will streamline the existing approval process and provide clarity on building safety requirements, allowable impacts to adjacent properties, and allowable exemptions.The scope of this project allowed for the possibility of residential solar PV projects being exempt from development permit requirements (as is the case in a number of Canadian and U.S. cities). While residential solar PV projects in Edmonton are not required to obtain building permits currently, they are required to submit design and installation drawings (stamped by a professional engineer) for City review. This process has raised concern amongst clients relative to project delays, increased costs, uncertainty about approval criteria, and the overall value of the review. Next Steps: A legal review to determine the appropriate level of City involvement in the review of residential solar PV projects (from a structural safety perspective) will be completed in Q1, 2017.

Driven by City Council’s vision to create a community that significantly reduces its ecological footprint and empowers residents to pursue sustainable lifestyle choices, Blatchford is a leading-by-example opportunity to showcase Edmonton’s commitment to becoming an energy sustainable city. The community will incorporate best practices for sustainable urban design including increasing density; prioritizing design that promotes walking, cycling or transit; creating a mix of housing, retail, commercial and public spaces; and incorporating significant park and green spaces. On December 8, 2016, City Council approved the community energy strategy, including the framework for a renewable energy utility that will further reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enable the effective use of energy. The plan relies on the following three strategies:o\tConservation: All buildings in Blatchford will incorporate green building features to reduce the amount of energy required.o\tEfficiency: An ambient district energy sharing system (DESS) will provide heating, cooling and domestic hot water for the buildings in Blatchford. It will be capable of sharing energy between buildings, neighbourhoods and seasons, significantly reducing overall energy demand. o\tRenewables: The use of on-site renewable energy sources including geo-exchange, solar PV and sewer heat exchange.Next Steps: After years of necessary planning, design, engineering and site preparation work, construction for the first residential stage and a section of the central park starts in spring 2017.

Edmonton Transit Service (ETS) Electric Buses: Over the past three years, ETS and Fleet and Facility Services have worked towards introducing battery-powered electric buses (e-bus) into its regular service fleet. This is part of the City’s commitment to exploring emerging technologies to create a more effective, efficient and ecologically responsible public transit service for Edmontonians. The first pilot project was conducted between May and October of 2014, testing two electric buses on Edmonton streets. In winter 2015/16, field trials showed that e-buses will operate effectively on Edmonton roads and throughout winter months. In June 2016, Administration provided a report to City Council outlining the results of winter testing and a business case for an initial deployment of 40 e-buses. The analysis indicates that e-buses is a cost neutral alternative to diesel buses. Based on present electricity generation in Alberta, it is estimated that an e-bus emits approximately 38 to 44 per cent less CO2 emissions than its diesel counterpart.Next Steps: City Council has directed Administration to purchase up to 40 e-buses, with funding available through the Public Transit Infrastructure Fund (PTIF). A request for proposals will be issued in the second quarter of 2017, with delivery of buses expected in late 2018/early 2019.

The current City (corporate) Operations GHG Management Plan was approved by Corporate Leadership Team in 2012. It sets an ambitious goal to reduce GHG emissions by 50% by 2020 (compared to 2008 levels). The reason the plan requires updating at this time is because a number of its key assumptions are obsolete – particularly those relating to infrastructure growth and the amounts of green power that would be purchased in this timeframe.

After receiving notification that its application was unsuccessful, Administration brought back a second report to Executive Committee on November 22, 2016 (CR_4178) recommending an electric vehicle charging station pilot project called Plug’n Go Edmonton that would fund the installation of 100 publicly-accessible Level 2 charging stations: 30 at City-owned facilities and 70 at privately owned facilities. It was intended that the pilot project would inform the development of Edmonton’s Electric Vehicle Strategy, including: (1) creating public awareness to encourage the uptake of electric vehicles, (2) understanding the relationship between electric vehicle purchases in Edmonton and the need for public charging station support, (3) evaluating the overall operational efficiency and effectiveness of Level 2 charging stations in Edmonton’s winter climate, and (4) understanding the potential effectiveness of different ownership and partnership models.In response to Council Report CR_4178, Executive Committee recommended the approval of capital funding for 30 electric vehicle charging stations on City-owned property. However, it did not approve funding for the 70 stations on private property. Instead, it requested that private ownership models be further explored when developing Edmonton’s Electric Vehicle Strategy. As well, Council postponed the decision on the capital funding for the 30 City-owned charging stations to April 2017.Next Steps: Fleet and Facility Services Branch will prepare a business case for the acquisition of electric vehicles to replace some of the existing light duty City fleet.

The preliminary numbers for the 2016 inventory suggest that the community is at 12% reductions below the 2005 baseline.  The City has built an in-house model and developed initiative level project charters to assess the GHG and financial return of all initiatives with confidence. Fort Collins is aligning the commitment to decarbonization with its energy policy, Road to Zero Waste goals, and long-range land use, transportation and transit planning. In the last decade, the community has doubled its transit ridership and is a designated Platinum bicycle city.  Fort Collins was an early adopter of Pay as You Throw and recently passed a new Recycling Ordinance, achieving a 58% diversion rate from the landfill. The community has increased its solar power capacity 3.5 times since adopting the goals, which included a highly publicized community solar garden that will provide access to renewable energy benefits to 20-25 families every year over the next 25 years, reaching at least 500 low income families. Our award-winning ClimateWise program has engaged over 400 businesses and reduced more than 1.3 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent, saving over $93 million, since its inception. Fort Collins was also the smallest jurisdiction ever selected to participate in the City Energy Project and was invited to apply, despite not meeting the typical population threshold, because of its demonstrated leadership and ability to ‘punch above its weight class.’","city_location":{"latitude":"40.5853","longitude":"-105.0844"},"country_location":{"latitude":"37.09024","longitude":"-95.712891"}}

Greensboro adopted a new Land Development Ordinance in 2010, which created standards for reduction of minimum required off-street parking when site is located within 1,000 feet of a transit stop, and/or when on-site bicycle parking is provided.  Off-street parking requirements can also be completely waived for development on existing lots that do not meet minimum lot width requirements.  A subsequent amendment to the LDO allows up to 100% shared parking, subject to certain conditions.  Incentives come in the form of reduced costs of parking construction and resulting stormwater management treatments, and simplified permitting process.  Also, structures officially designated as historic and structures (greater than 50 years old) deemed to have historic value, are exempt from off street parking requirements.  A reduction of up to 30% of required parking is available for sites served by greenways.
