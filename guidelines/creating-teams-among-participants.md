  If you are joining the collabathon without a specific team, this section will
  help you navigate through the process of how to find other participants with
  which you will want to join forces.

# Creating teams among participants

{% hint style="info" %}
**General remark.** Not everyone signs up for the event with a pre-established team. If you have joined alone, you can certainly participate on your own and contribute to the open source project and tackle specific prompts as you see fit. However, if you want to find peers to form a team and collectively tackle a prompt, then this will guide you through a suggested process to do so. The process of team formation applies whether you are attending a specific Node \(eg. at Yale or in one of the partner organisations\) or joining remotely, since there are no restriction on how teams are formed.
{% endhint %}

## Participant marketplace

The **participant marketplace** is the mechanism by which collabathon participants can find other ones and —according to any criteria desired— recruit other particpants to join or create a team. The criteria may be based on specific complimentary skills and know-how, eg. using the suggestions below, or any other criteria. To improve the marketplace and discover-ability between peers, participants are encouraged to describe their specific skills and background as well as prefered prompts, climate domains, or software layer. 

_\[This section will describe the current format for how participants discover other participants in a p2p way. It should start by describing the current format of Google Form and Spreadsheet discovery, and then include any improved method\]_

#### Upgrading the participant marketplace

As with most things in the collabathon spirit, if you think there is a way to improve one of the processes used in the collabathon —and know how to develop it— then you can either create a specific prompt or proposal within the 'Collabathon Prompts' section and then submit your proposed development and system. In fact, you should already find a prompt for a more sophisticated P2P marketplace 



## Ideal team setup

{% hint style="info" %}
There is not requirement or condition for team formation, neither on quantity of participants or backgrounds. However, here are general tips you can use in the process. 

...and remember, skills from software programming are very important for the collabathon, but definitely not the only skill needed nor mandated... _**anyone can contribute.**_

#### Team size

* Large teams, eg. over 10 participants, are hard to manage. Only form a large team if you have a sophisticated project management system and you are sure all participants can follow the same productivity and organisational procedure. 
* Small teams, eg. 2 or 3 people, are normally very specified to develop a specific hack given the diversity of skills and background can be limiting. However, this is very useful if you are targeting a technical 'Platform prompt.'
* A proposed balanced team will have between 3 to 8 people. This however is not prescriptive. 

#### Team composition

The challenges put forth in the prompts —particularly the 'Climate Prompts'— requires collective intelligence from multiple domains of expertise. Software programming is very important, but definitely not the most important skill, since much of the global climate accounting system requires deep understanding of the climate change space —both from the physical science side as well as the policy side.  Even within software development there are multiple valuable domains including data science, machine learning, graphical user interface design, blockchain and IoT engineering, etc. 

An ideal team could be composed of students with the following backgrounds:

* Climate researchers
* Front-end developers
* Back end developers
* UX/UI designers
* Blockchain developers
* Project managers & team coordinators

If you don't fit into the categories but have valuable expertise that you can contribute to our teams, please feel free to apply and indicate what you can contribute. However, for the purpose of standardising responses and ease of team formation through the participant marketplace, you are suggested to consider the above rubric.
