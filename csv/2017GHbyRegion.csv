Helsinki-Uusimaa,Finland,Europe,Public,2016 and 2017,1638293,2016,2015,Geopolitical Boundary,No,Other,"Other: Regionally developed methodology equivalent to GPH (and IPCC guidelines). KASVENER model is currently used in many municipalities in Finland to assess the direct emissions at the region of a municipality. The calculation model treats with energy production, industrial processes, traffic, agriculture, forestry, waste management, and domestic energy usage. Sorry the tool and this information is available only in Finnish.    Uudenmaan kasvihuonekaasupäästöt on laskettu samalla menetelmällä, jota käytetään pääkaupunkiseudun vuosittaisessa kasvihuonekaasujen päästöseurannassa. Laskenta perustuu Suomen Kuntaliiton ja Suomen ympäristökeskuksen kasvihuonekaasu- ja energiatasemalli Kasveneriin, joka noudattaa IPCC:n metodiikkaa ja käyttää Suomen päästöinventaarien laskentaparametrejä. Laskennassa otetaan huomioon kolme tärkeintä kasvihuonekaasua: hiilidioksidi (CO2), metaani (CH4) ja dityppioksidi (N2O). Tulokset esitetään hiilidioksidiekvivalentteina, jolloin metaani- ja typpioksiduulipäästöt muutetaan ilmastonlämmityspotentiaaliltaan vastaavaksi määräksi hiilidioksidia ja lisätään hiilidioksidipäästöihin. Tuloksia on Kasvener-laskennan jälkeen muokattu sähkönkulutuksen ja lämmityksen päästöjen osalta. Laskentamenetelmää kehitettiin Pääkaupunkiseudun ilmastostrategia 2030:n päästölaskentoja varten (YTV 2007). Strategian ilmestymisen jälkeen laskentaa muutettiin vielä sähkölämmityksen ja sähkönkulutuksen valtakunnallisen päästökertoimen laskennan suhteen (Lounasheimo 2009). Ilmastostrategian johtoryhmän nimen mukaan menetelmää on kutsuttu Hilma-metodiksi. Tärkein uudistus Kasveneriin verrattuna on sähkön ja lämmön yhteistuotannon päästöjen jyvittäminen hyödynjakomenetelmällä, jossa yhteistuotannosta syntyvä hyöty jakautuu kummallekin energiatuotteelle. Yhteistuotannon polttoaineet ja päästöt jaetaan sähkölle ja lämmölle niiden vaihtoehtoisten hankintamuotojen polttoaineiden kulutuksen suhteessa. Hyödynjakomenetelmä suosii perinteistä energiamenetelmää enemmän kaukolämmön yhteistuotantoa. Energiamenetelmässä polttoaineet ja päästöt jaetaan sähkölle ja lämmölle niiden tuotantomäärien suhteessa. Toinen keskeinen uudistus, josta sovittiin ilmastostrategiatyön yhteydessä, on kulutussähkön päästöjen laskeminen käyttämällä valtakunnallista päästökerrointa. Kerroin lasketaan jakamalla Suomen sähköntuotannon päästöt kokonaiskulutuksella (pois lukien sähkölämmityksen päästöt ja kulutus). Tuontisähkö on laskennassa päästötöntä. Sähköntuotannon päästöjen vuosivaihteluiden tasaamiseksi kertoimelle lasketaan viiden vuoden liukuva keskiarvo, jota käytetään päästölaskennassa. Vuosivaihtelut johtuvat muun muassa säätilasta, vesivoiman saatavuudessa pohjoismaisilla sähkömarkkinoilla, talouden suhdanteista johtuvasta sähkön kysynnän vaihtelusta, sähkön tuonnista ja viennistä sekä sähkön ja päästöoikeuksien hinnoista. Vuonna 2012 kulutussähkön valtakunnallinen päästökerroin oli 78 t CO2-ekv./GWh ja viiden vuoden keskiarvo 153 t CO2-ekv./GWh (kuva 58). Kerroin laski edellisvuodesta huomattavasti. Vähennys johtui sähkön nettotuonnin huomattavasta kasvusta ja hyvästä vesivoiman saatavuudesta (Energiateollisuus 2013a). Valtakunnallisen kertoimen käyttöä on perusteltu tulosten vertailtavuuden takia. Kunnissa tai kaupungeissa tuotettu sähkö ei rajaudu tietylle alueelle, vaan se myydään pohjoismaiseen sähköpörssiin, josta vastaavasti sähköyhtiöt ostavat sähköä ja myyvät edelleen asiakkailleen. Kaupunkien alueella toimivat voimalaitokset eivät välttämättä ole kaupunkien omassa omistuksessa tai eivät tuota kaupungin kulutukseen nähden tarpeeksi sähköä. Toisaalta kuntien omistuksessa olevat energiayhtiöt voivat omistaa osuuksia muualla Suomessa ja pohjoismaissa toimivista voimalaitoksista.

There are a large number of data sources used in its compilation, obtained from Government statistics, regulatory agencies, trade associations, individual companies, surveys and censuses. The methods used to compile the greenhouse gas inventory are consistent with international guidance on national inventory reporting from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Most emission estimates are compiled by combining activity data (such as fuel use) with a suitable emission factor (such as amount of CO2 emitted per unit of fuel used). Estimates of emissions from the industrial sector are often compiled based on plant-specific emissions data. Emissions from some sectors are based on more complicated models - such as the model used to estimate emissions from landfill, and the model used to estimate the carbon dynamics in soils when trees are planted. Much of the data on net emissions from agriculture and related land use, land use change and forestry emissions are based on modelled data for Scotland, which are consistent with, but not constrained to, the UK totals and thus are known as ""bottom up"" estimates. Many of the remaining emissions sources within the inventory have been collated on a ""top down"" approach where estimates of emissions have been apportioned to Scotland using proportions of energy use in the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) Publication ""Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES)"". This approach is prompted by data availability on emissions being more limited at the sub-UK level.

The Department undertakes all aspects of activity data coordination, emissions estimation, quality control, preparation of reports and their submission to the UNFCCC on behalf of the Australian Government. The Department publishes Australia's National Greenhouse Accounts, which are made up of a series of reports on greenhouse gas emissions estimates and include state inventory reports.  The National Greenhouse Accounts are produced within a national framework designed to create a nested set of integrated accounts â€” facility-level, company, industry, State and Territory and national. Estimation methodologies are consistent across each of these dimensions to ensure that changes in emissions at each level are captured efficiently and accurately across the accounts. The methodologies for the estimation of emissions are documented in Australia's National Inventory Report. The National Inventory by Economic Sector report provides emissions disaggregated by Australia-New Zealand Standard Industry Classifications (ANZSIC) and includes indirect emissions from the generation of purchased electricity (scope 2 emissions) Australia's greenhouse gas emissions are estimated using the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories and the 2013 Revised Supplementary Methods and Good Practice Guidance Arising from the Kyoto Protocol. Emissions factors used are IPCC 2006 defaults or Australian country specific estimates where improved data is available. Emissions for each of the major greenhouse gases are expressed as carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2e) using the 100-year global warming potentials (GWPs) contained in the 2007 IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC 2007).  Australia's emissions inventory is developed in accordance with an Inventory Improvement Plan, which aims to incorporate the latest science on emission processes and improved activity data as it becomes available.  Activity data and country specific emissions factors used to prepare the emissions inventory is taken where possible from the data collected under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (NGER) system. NGER is a legislative framework for the mandatory reporting of emissions, energy use and production by companies who exceed certain thresholds. NGER spans the energy, industrial processes and product use and waste sectors.  The remaining data is taken from other agencies, particularly Australia's principal economic statistics agencies; the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the Department of Industry, Innovation and Science. The ABS is the national statistical agency with legislative backing for its collection powers. The ABS, in conjunction with ABARES, is the major source of agricultural activity data. Satellite imagery is used to determine land cover change for the LULUCF sector and is sourced from Geosciences Australia (Australia's principal satellite ground station and data processing facility).  Data to support estimates of HFCs are sourced from compulsory reporting by importers under licensing arrangements under the Ozone Protection and Synthetic Greenhouse Gas Management Act 2003. The collection of solid waste data from State and Territory Government agencies is supported by an exchange of letters between Australian and State Government agencies. Electricity and natural gas consumption data are reconciled by comparing data collected under the NGER system with sources such as the Australian Energy Statistics, the Energy Supply Association of Australia and the Australian Energy Market Operator.  Emissions from electricity imported into New South Wales are not included in the state inventory report published by the Commonwealth. They are included in the state and territory scope two emissions from the generation of purchased electricity by economic sector and published separately by the Commonwealth in the report National Inventory by Economic Sector 2015. However, scope two emissions from electricity generation consumed within the electricity, gas and water sector includes own use of electricity by generators and is not necessarily purchased electricity. The NSW electricity region is interconnected with Victoria and Queensland, and includes the ACT. NSW emissions from imported electricity are estimated from the net electricity imports taken from the Australian Energy Market Operator's NEM Historical Market Information Report  and the full fuel cycle emissions from Victoria and Queensland according to the National Greenhouse Accounts Factors 2015 and relative to the net imports from these regions. The Department of the Environment produces the emissions estimates using IT systems called the Australian Greenhouse Emissions Information System (AGEIS) and, for the LULUCF sector, the Full Carbon Accounting Model (FullCAM). The AEGIS fully integrates quality control procedures into inventory preparation processes and centralises emissions estimation, inventory compilation and reporting, and data storage activities.

For all other sectors, geopolitical boundary. For 2012 and previous inventory years, geopolitical boundary for all sectors. ",No,"U.S. EPA Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (includes US EPA SIT, FLIGHT tool...)","The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's State Inventory Tool (SIT) calculates sector-by-sector GHG emissions based on numerous state-level and national-level data sets (e.g., number of gallons of fuel oil sold in CT), including energy-related data provided by the Energy Information Administration. In its guidance documents on SIT, EPA recommends that states employ their own data when these are likely to be more reliable than the tool's default figures.   The state inventory makes three major departures from the SIT default values. First, for the waste sector, the 2013 and 2014 inventories draw on solid-waste data collected by the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection's municipal waste program. Second, the 2013 and 2014 inventories also apply a consumption-based accounting approach for the electric power sector. In prior GHG inventories, emissions from the electric power sector were based on direct emissions from the generation of electricity by power plants operating within the state. As described in detail below, the new approach is based on the amount of electricity consumed within the state from the New England grid, rather the amount of electricity generated in the state. Third, because SIT data on land use, land use change, and forestry appear unreliable, they have not been included in the inventories of emissions in 2014 or prior years. The state aims to develop an alternative means to estimate GHG impacts of land use and forestry for use in preparing future inventories.  More on accounting for electricity-sector emissions: In GHG inventories prior to 2013, electricity sector emissions were calculated on the basis of GHGs emitted by power plants operating within the state. However, based on emerging best practices among U.S. states that regularly report their GHG emissions, and due to the nature of the New England electric grid, the Governor's Council on Climate Change recommended employing a consumption-based accounting approach: calculation of emissions from electricity consumed in-state, rather than electricity generated in-state. The state adopted this approach for the 2013 and 2014 inventories (and retrospectively applied it to estimate emissions in the period 1990-2012). This approach more accurately reflects significant historical and ongoing change in the mix of fuels used to generate electricity in New England. It also better aligns the inventory with actions Connecticut and other New England states have taken and can take to reduce emissions by promoting energy efficiency within New England and increasing generation of electricity from renewable energy sources in New England through policies such as the Renewable Portfolio Standard. A number of other states, including Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Maryland, and Oregon, have adopted a similar consumption-based approach for the electricity sector. While the consumption-based approach is now the primary method for calculating emissions from the electricity sector, DEEP continues to track and report emissions associated with in-state electric power generation for the purposes of comparison.   The two methods produce electricity-sector estimates that are roughly parallel: emissions were almost identical in 1990 (the baseline year for the GWSA's 2050 goal), peaked in the mid-1990s, and then significantly declined. In conducting the consumption-based inventory, DEEP draws on two data sources: Energy Information Administration data on Connecticut electricity consumption; and regional-grid carbon intensity data developed by the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MA DEP). MA DEP's data take into account the carbon intensity of electric generation within the ISO New England grid as well as electricity imported into the region from Canada, New York, and other jurisdictions.

Wales,Wales,Europe,Public,2016 and 2017,3099086,2015,2015,Other: Country boundary within the United Kingdom,Yes,2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,"Emissions are reported for the seven direct greenhouse gases, Carbon Dioxide, Methane, Nitrous Oxide, Hydrofluorocarbons, Perfluorocarbons, Nitrogen trifluoride and Sulphur hexafluoride. The estimates are expressed in terms of global warming potentials (GWPs) defined on a 100-year horizon (IPCC, 2007). The estimates and the GWPs are consistent with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) reporting guidelines and based on the 1990-2015 UK Greenhouse Gas Inventory, which was submitted to the UNFCCC in 2017.  The emissions for the Devolved Administrations of the UK (DA's) are reported on a by-source basis and emissions are accounted for by the source sector in which they are emitted, within each country. As such, emissions associated with imports are accounted for in the country where the production emissions are released. Total emissions from in country electricity production (regardless of the country of consumption) are assigned to Wales. Consistent with international and UK GHG inventory reporting protocol, the DA inventory totals presented exclude emissions from international shipping and aviation; however emissions from these sources are estimated separately. Emissions from offshore oil and gas exploration and production activities are not allocated to any country, and are estimated separately for the UK as a whole. In the compilation of GHG inventories for the DA's, where possible the same methodology has been used to calculate emission estimates as for the UK Inventory. However, the structure of the DA and UK statistical datasets and data collection processes mean that for many emission sources the data available for Devolved Administrations emissions are less detailed than for the UK as a whole, and for some sources DA-level data are not available at all. In particular, complete sets of fuel consumption data (similar to those available for the UK as a whole) are not available for England, Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland separately. In order to make emission estimates for fuel consumption, the available data has been supplemented with surrogate/proxy statistics which are used to disaggregate UK total consumptions data. Sub-national energy statistics are published annually by the Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC) within the quarterly Energy Trends publication. These sub-national statistics are limited in their detail when compared to UK-level energy statistics (used in the UK GHG Inventory compilation), but do provide estimated fuel use data for England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland for the following source sectors: â€¢ Industry and Commercial â€¢ Agriculture â€¢ Residential The DECC sub-national energy statistics have been developed in recent years to provide estimates of fuel use and carbon dioxide emissions data at a Local Authority level across the UK. The latest available data include Local Authority solid and liquid fuel use estimates for 2005 to 2014, with gas and electricity data also available up to 2015. The DECC data at local and regional level are derived from analysis of gas and electricity meter point data, supplemented by additional surveys to estimate the distribution of solid fuels and petroleum-based fuels across the UK. Since the initial study and presentation of experimental data for 2003 and 2004, each annual revision to the local and regional data has included data improvements through targeted sector research. These DECC sub-national energy statistics continue to evolve and improve, reducing data inaccuracies, but remain subject to greater uncertainty and less detail than the UK energy statistics presented within Digest of UK Energy Statistics (DUKES) which are used to underpin the UK GHG inventory. Despite the lack of detail and higher uncertainties, they are regarded as the best dataset available to inform the patterns of fuel use across the DAs. These data are used to underpin the carbon dioxide emission estimates from fuel combustion sources within the inventories presented here, in conjunction with other data sources such as EU ETS fuel use data for large industrial sites and other DA-specific energy data. For other significant GHG emission sources there are more reliable and complete country level datasets available including (although some of these are less detailed than data used for the UK Inventory): â€¢ Industrial process emissions are based on plant operator estimates reported to environmental agencies under regulatory systems such as Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). Major sources include cement and lime kilns, iron and steel works, aluminium and other non-ferrous metal plant, chemical industries; â€¢ Agricultural emissions are based on UK emission factors and annual survey data across each of the DAs including estimates of arable production and livestock numbers; â€¢ Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF) estimates are based on emission factors and regional survey data of land use, modelled to calculate GHG emissions and carbon fluxes between sources and sinks; â€¢ Emissions from waste disposal activities are estimated based on modelled emissions from the UK GHG inventory, split out across the DAs based on local authority waste disposal activity reporting which provides an insight into the local shares of UK activity for recycling, landfilling, incineration and other treatment and disposal options.  The 3% target has been adopted in Wales to reflect areas of devolved competence where the Welsh Government has the direct mandate to act to reduce emissions. Whereas, the 40% target incorporates all emissions in Wales and reflects the contribution that Wales makes to the overall UK commitments under the Climate Change Act 2008. The 3% and 40% targets reflect separate commitments that are based on different baselines and require different methodologies to compile. Performance reporting against the 40% target is drawn directly from the DA-GHGI by-source emissions total for Wales as described above. In addition to the by-source emissions inventory, emissions are also reported as a split traded / non-traded dataset (i.e. split by whether emissions are included in the EUETS). The inventory is also presented as an end-user product in which emissions are re-allocated to the final users of the energy to reflect emissions due to consumption, rather than production within Wales.  The end-user inventory is presented in two products: (i) an all energy supply activity end-user inventory (e.g. power generation, coal mining, oil and gas extraction, refineries), and (ii) an electricity generation only end-user inventory (reallocation of electricity generation emissions only). A UK-wide carbon intensiveness factor has been used to compile the Welsh electricity generation element of the end-user inventory, in recognition that the National Grid is entirely integrated across Great Britain. This approach will also minimise the volatility of the figures resulting from changes in generation (a Welsh specific carbon intensiveness factor would be vulnerable to large fluctuations from changes in the operation of individual power stations).  The 3% target includes all 'direct' greenhouse gas emissions in Wales, except those from the traded sector which are defined as those installations covered by the EUETS.

The National Inventory Report is a robust reflection of overall provincial emissions, is carried out in accordance with international reporting standards and is available to the public. The inventory is structured to match the reporting requirements of the UNFCCC and is divided into the following five main sectors: Energy, Industrial Processes, Agriculture, Land Use Land Use Change and Forestry (LULUCF), and Waste.

Attica,Greece,Europe,Public,2017,3828434,2011,2008,Geopolitical Boundary,Yes,2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories,"The level of administrative division of the Country into Regions, which has been the reference framework for the development of indicators, is the 13 Regions, as they are also referred to as NUTS 2. Each interregional indicator (1) has been compiled for each key sector of the economy as they refer to the relevant statistical classifications. The statistics on the basis of which the interregional indicators have been compiled contain the key elements that reflect the inter-regional capacity of the individual sector of the economy, which contributes to the maximum extent of the emission of each gas. The regional distribution of gaseous emissions was based on the above interregional indicators as well as on the total emissions of CO2 emissions of the country (CH4, N2O). The above emission figures for the main categories of the economy (Energy, Mining, Services, Agriculture, Transport, Households) are available in the NAMEA table, which were derived from the annual report entitled ""ANNUAL INVENTORY SUBMISSION OF GREECE UNTER THE CONVENTION AND KYOTO PROTOCOL FOR GREENHOUSE AND OTHER GASES FOR YEARS 1990-2014 "", which is compiled by the National Technical University of Athens - Department of Chemical Engineering on behalf of RIS. This work is a first step in the direction of the assessment of gaseous emissions at regional level, following collaboration with the School of Chemical Engineering / Division of Analysis, Design and Development of Processes and Systems of the National Technical University of Athens. In particular. Â The distribution of the Regional Emissions of GHGs from point and surface sources was as follows: A) Regional Distribution of Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Â Carbon dioxide (CO2) has as its main anthropogenic cause the consumption and use of carbon-containing fuels for the production of all kinds of energy. 1) For the distribution of CO2 from the Mining and Manufacturing Sector (Electricity Production), the indicator based on the use of the installed capacity of the thermal power plants in each Region was used and its index Added value of the Department of Mining and Processing by Region. 2) For the regional distribution of CO2 emissions from the households sector, a corresponding indicator was used which was the main element of the number of households per Region. 3) For the regional distribution of CO2 emissions from the transport sector, a corresponding index was used based on the added value of the Transport Sector in each Region. 4) Regional allocation of CO2 emissions from the Services sector used a corresponding index based on the added value of the Service Sector in each Region. 5) For the regional distribution of CO2 emissions from the Georgia sector, a corresponding indicator was used based on the added value of the Georgia Sector in each Region. B) Regional Distribution of Methane (CH4) Most of the CH4 emissions are from the agriculture sector, mainly from Livestock, as well as from the Water Supply and Sewerage sector, where the Sub-sector of Waste Management also belongs. CH4 is the second ranking in terms of dynamic impact on temperature rise. Its impact, expressed in CO2 equivalent, is 25% of CO2.Â Â Â Â  1) For the regional distribution of CH4 emissions from the agriculture sector (Livestock), a corresponding interregional indicator was used, which as the basic parameter had the number of animals and animal species per Region. 2) For the regional distribution of CH4 emissions from the Water Supply and Sewerage sector where it belongs and the Sub-sector of Waste Management was used as an indicator for the determination of the emitted gas per Region, the respective population per Region. It should be noted that estimates of the quantities of waste produced per Region publishing RIS were not considered as an optimal interregional indicator due to their significant annual variability. 3) For the regional allocation of CH4 emissions from the Services sector, the added value of the Services sector was used as an indicator for the determination of the emitted gas per Region. 4) For the regional distribution of CH4 emissions from the household sector, the number of households per region was used as the indicator of the emitted gas per Region. C) Regional Distribution of Nitrogen Oxide (N2O) Nitrogen Oxide (N2O) is the third in the ranking range in terms of the global warming potential expressed in CO2 equivalent. Its effects on climate change are about 298 times stronger than those of Carbon Dioxide (CO2). The main sources of Nitrogen Oxide (N2O) emissions are the agriculture sector from the use of nitrate fertilizers in the Mining and Processing sector as well as the Trade and Services sector. 1) Regional allocation of N2O emissions in the agricultural sector was used for the Agricultural Sector Value Added by Region Region. 2) For the regional distribution of N2O emissions in the mining and quarrying sector the Value Added Value Index of the Mining and Processing Sector per Region was used. 3) The regional distribution of N2O emissions in the trade and services sector used the index of the added value of the sector by region. 4) For the regional distribution of N2O emissions in the Households sector, the Households by Region Index was used. Remarks: For the estimation of gaseous emissions at regional level, the following assumptions were made: A) In the Transport sector, spatial assessment was made taking into account the number of vehicles circulating in each Region and not the corresponding fuel consumption. It has also been assumed that vehicles are circulating within the Region where the relevant marketing authorization has been issued. No account has been taken of the breakdown by sea and air transport. B) In terms of CO2 emissions from the households sector for the relevant estimates, the quantities of fuel consumed by households by region were not taken into account. It is also noted that: 1) The regional value added data comes from the Regional Accounts drawn up by ELSTAT.  2) The total number of households per region comes from the Family Budget Survey carried out by ELSTAT.

Lombardy,Italy,Europe,Public,2016 and 2017,10008349,2016,2015,Geopolitical Boundary,No,Other,"Other: The core of the methodology is the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. These guidelines are implemented in the Lombardy regional atmospheric emission inventory - INEMAR (INventario EMissioni ARia). This system has been developed within the framework of the Regional Air Quality Plan and is being managed since 2002 by the Regional Environmental protection Agency (ARPA Lombardia). ARPA Lombardia carries on the management and the update of the regional emission inventory, according to the Regional Law n.24/2006. The huge amount of data collected in the INEMAR system consists in activity indicators (e.g. fuel consumption, incinerated waste, etc.), emission factors, and statistical data necessary for the spatial and temporal disaggregation of the emissions. With INEMAR system, the emission inventories has been developed for the years 2001, 2003, 2005, 2008, 2010, 2012 and 2014 for GHGs (CO2, CH4, N2O), as well as for the main pollutants (SO2, NOx, NMVOC, CO, NH3, PM2.5, PM10, TSP). For the more recent editions, estimates on micro-pollutants like heavy metals and PAHs are also regularly updated. Emission of the three main fluorinated GHGs (HFCs, PFCs and SF6) and CO2 absorptions by forests (sinks) have been also assessed from the 2008 inventory; organic and elemental carbon (OC, BC) emissions have been estimated for the 2010, 2012 and 2014 inventories. According to the ARPA activity plan the most recent detailed release of the inventory is based on year 2014. The current detailed edition is now under public review at a very high level of detail, for each pollutant, around 255 activities 35 fuel types and for all the municipalities of Lombardy. In order to best monitoring the environmental performances of Lombardy a regional emission estimate, not detailed for all the municipalities, for accounting year 2015 has been developed and here presented. The estimates for 2015 are then provided as preliminary projection to be consolidated after the development of the detailed version of inventory. Previous estimates on 2014, presented last year, are also recalculated. Total amount estimates and detailed estimates are reported in the updated time series in annex 1.  The GHGs considered for the reporting in this Compact of States and Regions are CO2, CH4, N2O. CO2 equivalent (CO2e) emissions are estimated through the use of the Global Warming Potentials (GWP) proposed in the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report. The methodologies used for the assessment of direct emissions are consistent with those carried out by the National Environmental Protection Agency (ISPRA) for the National emission inventory, and are based on the IPCC Guidelines. Some differences exist for some activities (i.e. in the agriculture sector) due to different assumption on emission factors at local level. These differences doesn't have a significant impact on the total regional emissions. The split of GHGs emissions in different sectors is reported in the Annex 1. CO2e emissions from power consumption have been assessed indirectly, as ""Scope 2"" emission, through the product between the total consumption of electricity in the region (thus also the electricity imported) and the average CO2e emission factor for power generation in the region. The emission factor for power generation has been assessed by the ratio between all CO2e emissions related to electricity production in Lombardy (thermoelectric fossil fuels combustion and non-renewable share of waste burnt in waste-to-energy plants) and all electricity produced in Lombardy, including renewable energy.",CO2 (Carbon dioxide),CH4 (Methane),N2O (Nitrous oxide),,,,,76400000,"(45.46912, 9.185924)",50
